This mini project is taken from https://github.com/aamirpervez/React-JS-Complete-Course/tree/master/Food%20Ordering%20App
I added some twist which is the admin button
The original code, the items is hardcoded
The changes I made is connecting it with localstorage where we can add any item that we want
The idea is for the admin for the website can add or make changes to the menu
